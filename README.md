#**Colorandom**

##Introduction:
Users are welcome to explore our Colorandom page for color combination inspirations. Our site offers the opportunity to generate five random swatch colors at a time, save the colors that hold appeal, and refresh to see what other color combinations may be available. The user’s saved palettes can be seen in the sidebar.
This was a project assigned by the Turing School of Software and Design’s Front-End program.

##Set Up
To begin, choose ONE TEAM MEMBER to do the following:

1. Create a Slack DM with you, all project teammates, and your assigned project manager.
2. Locally, create a new folder containing an empty index.html file, a blank scripts.js file, and an empty     styles.css file.
3. Run git init in your terminal (make sure your working directory is your project folder).
4. Create an initial commit.
5. On GitHub, create a new repository. Follow the written instructions on GitHub to add the repo’s remote to your local project, and push your initial commit up to GitHub.
6. Add all project partners to the repository as contributors.
7. If your repository is set to private, add your project manager as a collaborator as well.

##Functions:
- When the page is initially opened, five random colors with their hex codes, an empty
  Saved Palettes side bar, and two buttons: New Palette and Saved Palette will be visible.
- To create a new palette, click the New Palette button; five colors will now be displayed on the main screen.
- To save a palette, click the Save Palette button; the palette will now be displayed on the side bar.

##Possible Future Extensions:
- Give the user the ability to lock and unlock a particular color.
- Give the user the ability to delete a saved palette.
- In the future, we would love to get through the offered extensions.
